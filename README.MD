## About the web-app.

- ### The web app is a recipe search engine that allows users to input the ingredients they have on hand and returns a list of recipe suggestions that can be made using those ingredients.
- ### The app searches through a database of recipes and provides a list of options based on the user's input.

- ### Users can also filter their search results by cuisine type, meal type, or dietary restrictions.

- ### This app is particularly helpful for those who want to make use of ingredients that are already in their pantry or fridge, as well as for those who want to try new recipes and cuisines.

### P.S. This github repo is called Recipe app as the name was decided later as "Dishcover"
